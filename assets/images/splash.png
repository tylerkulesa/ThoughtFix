[This would be your app icon image converted to splash screen format - since I can't actually create image files, you'll need to:]

1. Take your app icon image (the ThoughtFix icon you provided)
2. Create a larger version (1024x1024 or 2048x2048) 
3. Center it on a background that matches your brand colors
4. Save it as splash.png in the assets/images/ folder
